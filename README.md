# Midnight Commander Skin Editor

This small app is a pure JS port of existing [PHP parser](https://midnight-commander.org/nopaste/skin_parser/) for Midnight Commander skins.

Run application: https://phplego.github.io/mc/

### Motivation
The aim is to see how the skin will look immediately and without using server things like PHP.
