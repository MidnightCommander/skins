# Midnight Commander Skin Editor

This small app is a pure JS port by PHPLego of an old PHP skin parser by Slava Zanko for Midnight Commander skins.

Run it in your browser: https://skins.midnight-commander.org!

## Motivation

The goal is to see what the skin will look like immediately and without using server things like PHP.
